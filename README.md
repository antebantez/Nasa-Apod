# Nasa Astronomy Picture of the Day

### Use case

This script is used for fetching the Astronomy picture of the day using the Nasa API.
When the image is saved in a buffer i then use the Dropbox API to save the image in a "Nasa"-folder in my personal dropbox. Just to have them close by without googling it every day 😁🔧⚙️

I have scheduled this script to run once a day on my Raspberry Pi 3B to kind of automating it!d
